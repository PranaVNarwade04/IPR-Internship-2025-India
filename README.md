## 📂 Assignments & Projects

During the internship, I completed technical assignments bridging the gap between **Artificial Intelligence** and **IP Law**.

### 1. Research Paper: Patents and Artificial Intelligence
* **Topic:** *Patents and Artificial Intelligence: Legal and Ethical Issues*
* **Description:** Authored a study examining the challenges AI systems (like DABUS) pose to traditional patent laws.
* **Key Analysis:**
    * [cite_start]Analyzed the definitions of "Novelty" and "Inventive Step" in the context of AI-generated works[cite: 1, 7].
    * [cite_start]Explored the "DABUS case" and global judicial precedents (US/UK) regarding AI inventorship[cite: 17, 19, 23].
    * [cite_start]Evaluated the Indian legal context under Section 6 of The Patents Act, 1970[cite: 37].

### 2. Patent Analysis Case Study
* **Topic:** Analysis of Recent Indian Patent Applications in CS/AI.
* **Scope:** Conducted a deep-dive review of two cutting-edge patent applications:
    1.  **Federated YOLOv8:** *"System and Method for Privacy-Preserving Object Detection Using Federated YOLOv8 in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles"* (App No: 202531105457). [cite_start]Studied how edge computing and privacy are claimed as novel technical advancements[cite: 89, 96].
    2.  **Generative AI for Synthetic Data:** *"Generative AI for Synthetic Data Generation in Machine Learning Models"* (App No: 202541095529). [cite_start]Analyzed the use of GANs and VAEs to solve data scarcity and bias issues[cite: 91, 120].
